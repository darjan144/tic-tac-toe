Project Overview: Develop a Tic-Tac-Toe mini-game in Unity. The game is designed for
local multiplayer (two players on a single device) and must support both Portrait and
Landscape orientations.
## Scene Structure
- Play Scene (Main Menu)
The scene should contain three main buttons:
● Play Button: On click, opens a popup to select the "XO" theme. This popup should
also contain a "Start" button to transition to the Game Scene.
● Stats Button: Opens a statistics popup. Statistics must include:
○ Total games played.
○ Win count for Player 1 and Player 2.
○ Number of draws.
○ Average game duration.
● Settings Button: Opens a popup with two toggles to enable/disable Background
Music and Sound Effects (SFX), respectively.
● Exit Button: Opens a confirmation popup to quit the game.
## 2. Game Scene
This scene contains the gameplay board and the HUD.
● Gameplay: A 3x3 grid where players alternate placing X and O marks. When a
player connects three in a row, the game ends with a "Strike" animation.
● HUD (Heads-Up Display): Displays the current match duration, the move count for
both players, and a Settings button (identical to the one in the Play Scene).
● Game Over Popup: Appears at the end of the match. It should display the result
(e.g., "Player 1 Wins" or "Draw") and the match duration.
○ Buttons: "Retry" (restarts the match) and "Exit" (returns to the Play Scene).

## Required Popups
● Theme Selection: (From Play Scene) For choosing the visual style of game
elements.
● Statistics: (From Play Scene) Displaying accumulated data.
● Exit Confirmation: (From Play Scene) To quit the application.
● Settings: (From both scenes) For audio toggles.

● Game Result: (In Game Scene) Triggered upon match completion.
## Audio Requirements
● Background Music (BGM).
● Button Click SFX.
● Placement SFX (when a mark is placed on the board).
● Strike/Win SFX.
● Popup Animation SFX.

## Additional Instructions
● Assets: Use the provided graphics and audio. You are encouraged to add missing
assets, visual effects (VFX), or extra animations to polish the "Look & Feel."
● Persistence: The game should save statistics between sessions.
● Prioritization: Complete as much as possible within the deadline. Evaluation will be
based on the following priorities:
- Functionality & Playability: The core game loop must work perfectly.
- Code Quality & Readability: Clean, organized, and professional code.
- Look & Feel: Overall polish, completeness, and feature count.
